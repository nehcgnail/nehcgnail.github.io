## Dissecting Patient Safety Events through Data Science
### Understanding Patient Safety Events via Multi-label Text Classification and Semantic Representation
Medical errors are the third leading causes of death in the US. Patient Safety Event (PSE) reporting has been a national priority since the IOM report "To Err is Human" in 2000. Over the last few years, our work has been focusing on PSE reporting and analysis. In specific, we developed (1) a prototype upper-class ontology for encoding terminologies used in PSE, (2) machine-learning based text mining pipeline for categorizing PSE by error types, severity levels, contributing factors, and other clinically valuable variables, (3) theories, methods, and clinical implementation strategies of data-driven and informatics-powered approach to analyzing large-scale PSE tailored for real-world Root Cause Analysis (RCA) and clinical decision support. <br/>
