## Overview
Our earlier work focused on (1) knowledge representation of patient safety events using biomedical ontology and (2) automatic detection of critical information from patient safety events (e.g., error types, severity, and contributing factors) using clinical Natural Language Processing and machine learning. These studies were among the first that leveraged AI methods to analyze large-scale patient safety events to improve data interpretability and clinical workflow. <br/>
Current research is directed to integrating heterogeneous health data from multiple dimensions, medical knowledge representation, machine learning, and clinical Natural Language Processing with a focus on developing medical informatics tools for precise, timely, and interpretable screening, diagnosis, phenotyping, and clinical decision support. Much of the recent work was done with [the Big Data Health Science Center](https://bigdata.sc.edu) at the University of South Carolina.<br/>

### Dissecting Patient Safety Events through Data Science
Medical errors are the 3rd leading cause of death in the US. Patient Safety Event (PSE) reporting has been a national priority since the IOM report "To Err is Human" in 2000. However, electronically collected reports are poor in interpretability and there is a appearant gap in tranlating the data to actionable knowledge. We developed (1) a prototype upper-class ontology for encoding terminologies used in PSE, (2) a machine-learning based text mining pipeline for categorizing PSE by error types, severity levels, contributing factors, and other clinically valuable variables, (3) theories, methods, and clinical implementation strategies for applying these informtics tools in real-world Root Cause Analysis (RCA) and clinical decision support. <br/>
