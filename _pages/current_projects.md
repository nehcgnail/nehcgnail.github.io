### Deep Phenotyping individuals with PASC using a Graph representation model of S3C
It is estimated that millions of people will experience long-lasting health consequences, denoted as Post-Acute Sequela of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC). This projected disease burden will have a profound public health impact during post-COVID-19 care. Preliminary findings are inconclusive in part because of the heterogeneous findings from existing small and single-center cohorts, complex pathophysiological nature of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the time constraints for collecting data from longitudinal clinical trials. To address these challenges, we propose a high-throughput Deep Phenotyping approach to identify and characterize phenotypes (e.g., morphological, physiological, biomedical, socio-behavioral data, and nuanced phenotypic traits) of individuals with PASC using multi-modal, longitudinal, extended Electronic Health Records (EHR) data from the South Carolina COVID-19 Cohort Collaborative (S3C). Leveraging clinical Natural Language Processing and Semantic Web Ontology methods, we will design and construct a Graph representational model on top of S3C. We will develop unsupervised Graph-based clustering algorithms, including Deep Learning, and incorporate multi-level and iterative clinical evaluation to detect, identify, and validate Graph-based phenotypes for individuals with PASC. We will exploratory analyze validated phenotypes to answer a list of high-profile research questions (e.g., prevalence of symptoms, associated multi-system/organ dysfunction, risk factors, health disparity, and treatment intervention strategies). Anticipated findings are urgently needed to mediate the heavy burden of US health systems during post-COVID-19 care and to guide clinical trial design for PASC cohorts. Our Deep Phenotyping approach will break new ground by 1) creating an innovative EHR representational model tailored for the high-dimensional and temporal dynamic data of COVID-19 and 2) developing unsupervised clustering algorithms designed for tackling the absence of clinical gold standard for PASC, in which both will not only be a timely response to the PASC crisis, but also a demonstration of the potential of Big Data approach in advancing immune mediated and infectious disease research.

### Deep Learning Assisted Opioid Use Disorder Diagnosis Using EHR data
Electronic Health Records (EHR) hold great promise in assisting providers to identify individuals with possible opioid use disorder (OUD), treatment referral, as well as for onsite buprenorphine initiation protocols that are highly effective in the field. We develop Deep Learning models to assist providers in OUD diagnosis by harnessing individuals’ chronological EHR using clinical Natural Language Processing (NLP).

### Towards Personalized Discharge Summaries for Reducing Medication-related Harm
The heterogeneous contributing factors found in preventable medication-related harms suggest that intervention strategies (e.g., patient coaching/education, discharge instructions, coordination, and medication reconciliation) should reflect personalized needs of patients and context-specific discharge. We use Electronic Health Records (EHR) chart review to collect clinical decision rules about personalized information to be provided by clinicians. We then develop Deep Learning models to automatically learn from EHR and clinical decision rules to suggest personalized information at discharge.
